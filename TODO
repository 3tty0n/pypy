* find a better way to run "find" without creating the index storage,
  if one is not already readily available (understand cost now, improve after merge)

* improve performance of splitlines
* stop using runicode/unicode and move MAXUNICODE to rutf8 (Matti)
* think about cost of utf8 list strategy (Armin and CF)
