We can try to make generate_quick_failure() emit two instructions less:
the two store_reg() [one in generate_quick_failure and the other in
push_gcmap].  Instead we'd load the values in known unused registers,
and the store_regs would occur inside self.failure_recovery_code
(which 'target' points to).
