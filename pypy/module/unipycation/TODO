Proposed Interface
==================

Variables and Terms
--------------------

X = unipycation.Var()
t = unipycation.Term('f', [X]) # is equivalent to "f(X)"

Querying
--------

for solution in e.query(t, [X]):
	print solution[X]

Subsequent Queries
------------------

The same? is X reusable? Yes. Cool.
